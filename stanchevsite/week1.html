        Database Systems Project Idea
        <br/>
        The idea is to have updated information about current students that other students, faculty, and companies can look up. This will not release any private information about the student like GPA, just information like major, minor, year, section, work locations, etc. This can be used by companies to be more proactive about looking for co-op students or full time hires and the availability of the student should be listed and sorted by the companies specified interests. Teachers course schedules for the current term should also be posted for students to view and potentially schedule meetings around.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <p>Perry<br/>
        Idea: a database specifically for guest credits
        Each entry would have a reference number.
        Also listed would be the name of the university at which the guest credit can be taken.
        The name and number of the course at the guest institution.
        The name and number of the equivalent course at Kettering.
        The number of credits of the course at the guest institution.
        The number of equivalent credits at Kettering.
        Location of the guest institution.

        Setting up a database this way would allow for a student to easily search for a course at Kettering which they would like to take for equivalent credit at another university.

        Example: search for HUMN 201 and see all universities which transfer the credits.

It would allow teams to easily see when their games are, what place they are in, etcetera. Also, it would allow individual players to see their statistics, including goals/points scored, games played, and so on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This would also provide a reliable means of knowing which color shirt to wear: light or dark. In the past, this has been a problem since usually neither team knows if they are technically home or away. However, each team would be assigned to either home or away and this would be clearly visible in the database.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only would the players benefit from such a database system, but so would the Recreation Center, which organizes the sports. Once all teams are registered, they can input them into the database and easily see when games are to assign referees to. They can also see the rankings of teams at the end of the season to create the playoff bracket.</span></p><p class="c0"><a name="h.gjdgxs"></a><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Recreation Center is using a manual solution to organize intramural sports, so having a database to do the work for them would be very helpful. Currently, goals scored and other statistics for each player and team are not recorded and therefore not available, but having this database will make doing so pain-free and available to the players.</span></p>

With the movement towards an &ldquo;internet of things&rdquo; connectivity is being extending to household appliances, allowing consumers to monitor and control their &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; over the internet.

Currently, there are only a small amount of commercially available connected appliances, many of which are still very expensive.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">While this project focuses specifically on a making a connected coffee maker, it presents a framework by which a mobile web application and a back-end server could be used to control a variety of household appliances.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Approach</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Several steps are needed to realize the system including modifying the coffee maker, building the back-end, and developing the mobile web application.

This will allow the small current from an I/O pin of a Raspberry Pi to actuate the switch inside the relay and control the much larger current required to turn the coffee maker on. </span></p><p class="c2"><a name="h.gjdgxs"></a><span class="c0">An RPi will become the &ldquo;brain&rdquo; of the coffee maker, using a Python program to turn the device ON/OFF and communicate with back-end to receive commands and send status information. Communication between the RPi and the back-end will be facilitated using a python implementation of the WebSocket protocol. This allows bi-directional data communication over a single TCP connection once an initial connection has been established.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The back-end will consist of a web server and a database. The web server will listen for WebSocket connections allowing commands sent from the mobile web application to be forwarded to the coffee maker. Options such as Node.js and Ruby on Rails will be considered for implementing this server. The database will store user login information and brewing history.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The mobile web app running in the mobile device&rsquo;s browser will also communicate with the back-end using the WebSocket protocol. UI for the app will be implemented using HTML5/CSS3/JS. In addition, the use of a JavaScript MVC framework such as Backbone.js or Angular.js will be investigated to ease development.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Benefit</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The proposed system provides several benefits. First, users can brew coffee remotely and have it ready when they return home. For example, a student walking home from class on a cold winter day could remotely initiate brewing, allowing the coffee to be ready when he/she walks in the door.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Multiple data sources such as brewing history, weather conditions, GPS location, etc. could be used to predict when a particular user might want coffee and ask them if they would like some to be brewed.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The app could also allow users to setup recurring brewing schedules, or even integrate with a user&rsquo;s calendar. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c1">Competition</span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0">After conducting online research, one commercially available internet connected coffee maker was found (</span><span class="c0 c3"><a class="c6" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mrcoffee.com%2Fcoffeemakers%2FBVMC-PSTX91WE.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHiBwo07TME-96E9L-Rcp_YS63DZw">http://www.mrcoffee.com/coffeemakers/BVMC-PSTX91WE.html</a></span><span class="c0">). This product was recently released and has an MSRP of $249.99. In addition to its high cost, this product does not have all features listed above.</span></p>

        <br/>
        <p>The idea is to create a web interface for updated information about current students that other students, faculty, and companies can look up. This will not release any private information about the student like GPA, just information like major, minor, year, section, work locations, etc. This can be used by companies to be more proactive about looking for co-op students or full time hires and the availability of the student should be listed and sorted by the companies specified interests. Teachers course schedules for the current term should also be posted for students to view and potentially schedule meetings around.</p>

        <p class="c2"><span>Jerry Brown-Lacy CS-341 Winter 2015</span></p><p class="c0"><span>At Kettering university there is an abundance of housing alternatives to use as opposed to using the dorms. These options however are not very obvious and, information on these options are not readily available. My proposed web app would be used to provide students or staff to login, post information about available housing options so that students will be able to access the information at any time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>The system will enable students to post off campus housing locations. When these are posted they will also post the maximum number of residents and the number of residents living their currently. Students may then contact the landlord based on the information found on the site to see if they will be able to visit the house if any spots are still available.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Each house will have a separate section for both A and B section so that the students will be able to view the correct information at any time. The house listing will contain basic pricing information as well as a location on a map so that you know how close to campus you are located.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>As a separate section of the app there will be a place for students to post about a roommate search. This feature will allow students to find potential roommates working in the same area during work term.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Users will need to be able to search for a house near campus by distance, number of open spots and cost. Users will also need to search for work term roommates by location and number of desired roommates.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span></span></p>

          A good use for students at kettering and also for the community of Flint is an enhancement of Kettering’s radio station WKUF’s website. I think that it would be a good idea to build a song request feature for the website so people can go on and request a song for the DJ to play. This would involve some database work to store votes and a lot of front end work to make sure that users aren’t able to vote multiple times and to build out a form to submit your vote and a page to display the vote results. This can be accompanied by a few more features:
          <br/>
            -A redesign of the rest of the WKUF website to make it more appealing and easier to use
            <br/>
            -A area to choose from recorded shows to listen to again.
