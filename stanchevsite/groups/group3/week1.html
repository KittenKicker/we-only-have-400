        Database Systems Project Idea
        <br/>
        The idea is to have updated information about current students that other students, faculty, and companies can look up. This will not release any private information about the student like GPA, just information like major, minor, year, section, work locations, etc. This can be used by companies to be more proactive about looking for co-op students or full time hires and the availability of the student should be listed and sorted by the companies specified interests. Teachers course schedules for the current term should also be posted for students to view and potentially schedule meetings around.

        Idea: a database specifically for guest credits
        Each entry would have a reference number.
        Also listed would be the name of the university at which the guest credit can be taken.
        The name and number of the course at the guest institution.
        The name and number of the equivalent course at Kettering.
        The number of credits of the course at the guest institution.
        The number of equivalent credits at Kettering.
        Location of the guest institution.

        Setting up a database this way would allow for a student to easily search for a course at Kettering which they would like to take for equivalent credit at another university.

        Example: search for HUMN 201 and see all universities which transfer the credits.
