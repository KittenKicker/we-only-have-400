They could also sort on a keyword topic in order to find out if there is a club out there based on their interest.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Benefits: </span><span>This would improve club participation and advertisement. It would also allow people who do not attend the Carnival of Clubs to find out when clubs are meeting and try them out.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Competition: </span><span>The Kettering calendar has some information on when and where a club meets but it is difficult to navigate and not always accurate.</span></p>

It would allow teams to easily see when their games are, what place they are in, etcetera. Also, it would allow individual players to see their statistics, including goals/points scored, games played, and so on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This would also provide a reliable means of knowing which color shirt to wear: light or dark. In the past, this has been a problem since usually neither team knows if they are technically home or away. However, each team would be assigned to either home or away and this would be clearly visible in the database.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only would the players benefit from such a database system, but so would the Recreation Center, which organizes the sports. Once all teams are registered, they can input them into the database and easily see when games are to assign referees to. They can also see the rankings of teams at the end of the season to create the playoff bracket.</span></p><p class="c0"><a name="h.gjdgxs"></a><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Recreation Center is using a manual solution to organize intramural sports, so having a database to do the work for them would be very helpful. Currently, goals scored and other statistics for each player and team are not recorded and therefore not available, but having this database will make doing so pain-free and available to the players.</span></p>

Also makes it easier to track things like grades and sort by specific requirements such as all members of fraternity X with grades above 2.50 cumulative GPA. For emailing purposes, easy to query for all the Philanthropy Chairs for every fraternity/sorority and grab their email addresses for information about community service/philanthropy. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p><span class="c2 c5">Intended Audience</span><span class="c2">: Greek Life Coordinator (full access), members of the Greek Community (limited access)</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p><a name="h.gjdgxs"></a><span class="c2">The idea here is to basically create a system that combines a various number of different systems (all the way from a grade database from Kettering to an excel spreadsheet printed out and taped to a wall) so that all of the duties of the Greek Life Coordinator at Kettering can be done efficiently. In addition to added efficiency, this system will also allow easier interpretation of data. It will be easier to see which person in fraternity X has the most community service and will also be able to see what the email is for the president of every fraternity/sorority. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2"></span></p>
