		<h2>NABC</h2>
		<p>NABC stands for Need, Approach, Benefit, Competition. By looking at these four categories, a developer is able to create and deliver customer value that is greater than their competition. Anyone developing anything wants what they are making to be better than anyone elses. By starting with the value proposition: NABC, the developer is able to answer the four questions proposed by NABC and see if what they are making will be of greater customer value than their competition. These questions are:<p><br/>
		<p>
		- What is the important customer and market Need?<br/>
		- What is the unique Approach for addressing this need?<br/>
		- What are the specific Benefits that result from this approach?<br/>
		- How are these benefits superior to the Competition's and the alternatives?

		<p class="c2"><span class="c0">The database will contain information for each of the sections of this project. The database for the FIRST location will need a table that will log the students at Kettering who are part of FIRST teams and it will also need to keep track of the FIRST teams who are choosing to use the space. This would be through linking the table of FIRST teams to a table of usages of the space (time, date, tools etc.). We would want to build a UI where the user can search for a student and find out if they are part of the team. The FIRST space could be accessed by an ID card and we can set privileges for students (when they can access, etc).</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Since this space will be used by many people it would be beneficial for a way to communicate between the people using the space. The Forum database would allow user (user table) to talk to one another through messages and boards (message/thread tables) and this would allow for people to collaborate on projects going on in the space.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The last part of this project is a Proposal system. With all of the things going on in the space people might want there to be things added to the space that would help their FIRST team build their robot easier or better. We would want to set up a proposal type table that would allow the user to specify the type of proposal (monetary, tool, etc.) and then give a description about what they want. Each proposal would be tied to a user that submitted the proposal. We would have someone be able to review and approve or deny the proposal but limit the people who can review down to people with privileges to do so.</span></p>

Their student id number will be their unique identifier. Also there can be a list of the courses the student has completed or is currently enrolled in, though grades will not be available since they are confidential.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For a teacher, information about their current class schedule if they are teaching and their department will be available and they will each have a unique id number. This list will hold both current classes and classes that are unavailable for a given reason. It will contain the Prerequisites/Corequisites for the class, the kind of credits that it counts towards, the instructor teaching it, a brief description of the course, and a list of the software used in the course.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For a company, information about the location of their office(s) as well as per location job listings and descriptions, coupled with an application form and any requirements (such as major or year) will be components for the company entity.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For a university, there will be a list of classes that are accepted by Kettering as guest credits, the location of their campus(es), and a unique school id. This will allow for Kettering students to easily find courses which can be taken for guest credit. Currently, the course equivalency system available online is setup to be convenient to use for transfer students, but cannot be conveniently used to look for guest credits. This database would solve this problem by allowing students to search by the course title at Kettering and see all schools which offer an equivalent course that can be taken as a guest credit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For a house or apartment complex, there will be a location of the house or apartment and reviews from Kettering students about living circumstances. These listings will have to be input by a student who is looking for roommates, other students will be able to look for available housing and narrow it down based off location. Each listing will include the cost per person, the number of desired roommates, and pictures of the house or apartment. They will also include contact information for the poster as well as for the landlord. These listings will be categorized by section to prevent confusion and mistakes. They will also have an optional place to add pictures and information about current residents in the house. When looking for roommates for work term posters will have the ability to submit only the location of the work and how far they are willing to commute in order to better facilitate the roommate search process.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This system will allow companies to be proactive about looking for students to hire based on their criteria, such as a specific major and grade level. It will also allow for students to be more</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">proactive about looking for companies as well based on similar criteria. Students will also be able to search for classes that have guest credit transfers while looking up Kettering classes.</span></p>

        <br/>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Need</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Mobile devices are enabling people to become more connected to the world around them. With the movement towards an &ldquo;internet of things&rdquo; connectivity is being extending to household appliances, allowing consumers to monitor and control their &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; over the internet. As people become more connected, the demand for connected appliances will likely grow. Currently, there are only a small amount of commercially available connected appliances, many of which are still very expensive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">While this project focuses specifically on a making a connected coffee maker, it presents a framework by which a mobile web application and a back-end server could be used to control a variety of household appliances.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Approach</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Several steps are needed to realize the system including modifying the coffee maker, building the back-end, and developing the mobile web application. A simple coffee maker will be modified by placing a relay in series with its ON switch. This will allow the small current from an I/O pin of a Raspberry Pi to actuate the switch inside the relay and control the much larger current required to turn the coffee maker on. </span></p><p class="c1"><a name="h.gjdgxs"></a><span class="c2">An RPi will become the &ldquo;brain&rdquo; of the coffee maker, using a Python program to turn the device ON/OFF and communicate with back-end to receive commands and send status information. Communication between the RPi and the back-end will be facilitated using a python implementation of the WebSocket protocol. This allows bi-directional data communication over a single TCP connection once an initial connection has been established.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The back-end will consist of a web server and a database. The web server will listen for WebSocket connections allowing commands sent from the mobile web application to be forwarded to the coffee maker. Options such as Node.js and Ruby on Rails will be considered for implementing this server. The database will store user login information and brewing history.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The mobile web app running in the mobile device&rsquo;s browser will also communicate with the back-end using the WebSocket protocol. UI for the app will be implemented using HTML5/CSS3/JS. In addition, the use of a JavaScript MVC framework such as Backbone.js or Angular.js will be investigated to ease development.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benefit</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The proposed system provides several benefits. First, users can brew coffee remotely and have it ready when they return home. For example, a student walking home from class on a cold winter day could remotely initiate brewing, allowing the coffee to be ready when he/she walks in the door.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Multiple data sources such as brewing history, weather conditions, GPS location, etc. could be used to predict when a particular user might want coffee and ask them if they would like some to be brewed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The app could also allow users to setup recurring brewing schedules, or even integrate with a user&rsquo;s calendar. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Competition</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c2">After conducting online research, one commercially available internet connected coffee maker was found (</span><span class="c2 c3"><a class="c4" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mrcoffee.com%2Fcoffeemakers%2FBVMC-PSTX91WE.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHiBwo07TME-96E9L-Rcp_YS63DZw">http://www.mrcoffee.com/coffeemakers/BVMC-PSTX91WE.html</a></span><span class="c2">).

        <h2 class="c1"><a name="h.pbw2v3m91slv"></a><span>Description</span></h2><p class="c3"><span></span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span>This project will be enhancements to Kettering&rsquo;s radio station&rsquo;s (WKUF&rsquo;s) website. We will be adding features that will allow a user to submit a request for a specific song to be played without needing to call in to the radio station. Another feature that will be added is an on-demand radio section that will allow the user to choose a DJ that they would like to listen to and then pick one of their previous broadcasts to listen to online.</span></p><h2 class="c0"><a name="h.ttlenus6v17v"></a><span>Need</span></h2><p class="c4 c2"><span>Currently, WKUF does not have an effective way for a user to request a song. They would either have to know the phone number for the station or they would need to know the DJ on Facebook and contact them through that means. This is not an ideal way and it would be a big improvement for both the DJs and the people who wish to request a song to be played on air for them.</span></p><h2 class="c0"><a name="h.nnf6y3olfua8"></a><span>Approach</span></h2><p class="c3"><span></span></p><p class="c4"><span>We will be starting with the on-demand and song request features. We will split up the team such that 2 people are working on the on-demand feature as it will require more work, and one member of the team will be working on the song request feature. If either section is finished first, the member(s) working on that section will help the other member(s) finish their section. If there is time after these features are added, then we will begin to improve existing areas of WKUF&rsquo;s website.</span></p><h2 class="c0"><a name="h.vbd87g9g5x33"></a><span>Benefit</span></h2><p class="c3"><span></span></p><p class="c4"><span>As stated previously, this project will greatly benefit the DJs of the radio station as well as Kettering students and members of the Flint community that listen to the station. This will consolidate the song request process into one location for the DJs to check and listeners to visit. Many other radio stations have a song request section. Some DJs of other radio stations have their broadcasts saved as podcasts for users to listen to from the website. This will help Kettering&rsquo;s WKUF to continue to thrive and grow in listenership.</span></p><h2 class="c0"><a name="h.v61vkc6ksw6u"></a><span>Competition</span></h2><p class="c3"><span></span></p><p class="c4"><span>The competition to this project is other radio stations throughout the Flint area. These radio stations are commercial so it is not expected that our project will increase listenership to surpass any of these stations, but WKUF has a loyal listenership for its shows and this will help to make those listeners happy and hopefully attract more.</span></p>
